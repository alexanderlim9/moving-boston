# Moving Boston 2030 🚌
We've made it! It's our fifth year and final semester at Northeastern and we're wrapping it all up with our senior capstone project. Or at least... we'll try our best! 😅

## Overview
Moving Boston 2030 is an interactive narrative addressing the future of public transit in Boston. Why did we choose this project? Well, we're all huge nerds! 🤓We _love_ all things transit and we're all combined computer science & design majors. Moving Boston is our way of tackling an issue of public interest that meets our own _personal_ interests and applies ourselves to use what we've learned in our time at Northeastern. 🎓
